# CODSOFT
Overview:
Welcome to my repository for the "CODSOFT Internship Program", where Iâ€™ve completed a series of hands-on tasks focused on "Python programming", logical thinking, and project-based development. Each task in this repository demonstrates different aspects of programming skills, ranging from basic control structures to creating interactive applications.

# Tasks Overview:

    Task 1 : CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES 
    Task 2 : TIC-TAC-TOE AI
    Task 3 : IMAGE CAPTIONING
    Task 4 : RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
    Task 5 : FACE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION

# Learnings: 
Combined Learnings from Tasks 1, 2, and 5
Through the completion of these tasks, I strengthened my understanding of both foundational and applied Python programming concepts:
1. Core Programming & Logic
Utilized control flow statements (if, else, elif) and loops to manage program logic.
Organized code into modular functions for clarity, reusability, and scalability.

2. AI & Decision-Making
Implemented the Minimax algorithm to simulate intelligent decision-making in games.
Explored recursive logic and backtracking, allowing AI to evaluate all possible outcomes and choose optimal strategies.
Gained practical knowledge of Maximizer-Minimizer roles in adversarial game design.

3. Pattern Recognition & User Interaction
Applied simple pattern matching for handling natural user input in the chatbot.
Built a conversational flow using static rules and keyword detection.

4. Computer Vision with OpenCV
Used Haar Cascade Classifiers for face detection in images.
Performed image preprocessing steps such as grayscale conversion and resizing for efficient processing.
Visualized results using bounding boxes and OpenCV's GUI functions.
